This is the directory where dynamically generated host and service configs are placed.

The configs are being generated by the "radar" service running on the nagios container.

Radar is scanning the nagios log file for unknown hosts and services from passive alerts and automagically creating configs for them.

You can disable this functionality by commenting out the following line in the nagios Dockerfile:

ADD radar.init /etc/sv/radar/run
